Hello there!

Corrino Software has just released the game Pizarro for the iPhone.  It is available in the iTunes App Store as of today.

Pizarro is a new iPhone arcade strategy game with a smooth, jazzy feel and simple but addictive gameplay which makes intelligent use of the touch interface.  The objective in each level is to cover 80% of the area by creating expanding circles with your fingers while avoiding collisions with moving objects. Although the basic gameplay is simple, it is difficult to master and offers virtually endless replayability.

Gameplay gets progressively more difficult as you advance through the levels, demanding more strategic placement of circles.  

The game integrates blues music into the gameplay itself. Groovy walking bass lines and musical notes played on object collision create a smooth, jazzy atmosphere.

Pizarro is fully integrated with Apple Game Center.  Scores are posted to leaderboards and the game includes 12 achievements.

A tutorial and gameplay video introducing the game is available at the following URL:
